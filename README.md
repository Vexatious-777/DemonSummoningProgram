# DemonSummoningProgram

This project is a personal project for me to demonstrate Full-Stack Development skills and cloud deployment as well as a love
letter to the "Shin Megami Tensei" video game series. I also utilized a Web Scraper to pull the demon information and images from the Megaten wiki (THANK YOU!!!) I built using AI assistance due to my unfamiliarity with BeautifulSoup4. Which will be uploaded on it's own in a different Repo named Papa after Papa Legba (Recently learned about the voodoo figure meant to help people bridge the living world and spiritual though it kind of fitting if not immediately connected to SMT).
